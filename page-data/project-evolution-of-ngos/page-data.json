They regulate behaviors, facilitate communication, and promote\ncooperation between states. The process by which International\nOrganizations come into being is well discussed in the literature,\nhowever, not equally well debated is the process by which International\nOrganizations come to modify their operating procedure. Or in other\nwords, when the member states renegotiate the terms of their membership.</p>\n<h2>Literature Review</h2>\n<p>Kenneth Waltz argues that domestic politics is irrelevant to the\ncalculus of states. He argues primarily that states act according to the\nactions of other states. The bureaucracy, the public, and the legal\nsystems are all factors not considered in his framework. He does however\ntake the position that “politics determines economics (Waltz 2010)”, but\ndoes not further his sociological analyses. In other words, he accepts\nthat the behavior of states is derive from the socially constructed\npolitical process, but does not analyze human systems to other than the\nstate when attempting to predict state behavior. (Waltz 2010)</p>\n<p>Robert Keohane builds upon Waltz. He takes the assumption that there are\ninherent common interests between states seeking wealth and power, and\nthe maximization of absolute gains. States are then presumed to possess\npreferences dependent on the division of resources and information\nwithin the international system. To accomplish goals and to minimize\ninsecurity states then cooperate by forming international regimes\ndefined to be, “sets of implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules,\nand decision-making procedures around which actor’s expectations\nconverge in a given area of international relations” (Keohane, 2005, p\n57). In bargaining for international trade deals, states seek to\nmaximize power and wealth for all states involved in the process.\n(Keohane, 2005)</p>\n<p>Fearon also adopts this position, however also assumes that states seek\nwhen bargaining the maximization of gains across time. Therefore the\nlogic of the iterated prisoners dilemma is used to explain cooperation.\nBecause of the shadow of the future, or the expectations of further\ninteraction between states, the most rational choice to maximize gains\nacross time is for states to cooperate and to normalize rules in the\nform of a legalistic International Organizations. (Fearon 1998)</p>\n<p>Moravsic adopts a liberal stance, breaking from the neorealist, as well\nas the regime theorist position that the factors of the international\nsystem determines state behavior. He argues that the preferences of\npowerful coalitions within states and the combined societal will to\ncarry them out are the basis for state behavior. His theory rests upon\nthree core assumptions. 1. State actors primarily define state\npreference. 2. Domestic institutions and their structure exert influence\non the realization of coalition preferences. 3. “The configuration of\ninterdependent state preferences determines state behavior (Moravsic,\n1997).” Thus, powerful social coalitions pressure representative\ngovernments, controlling for regime type, to bargain on the behalf of\ntheir interests in the international game. This “two stage model” of\nstate behavior accounts for both regime theorist and realist\nassumptions.</p>\n<p>Putnam further formulizes the process with the application of the\ntwo-level game metaphor (1988). Level 1 is considered the domestic game\nplayed by representative leaders to appease the domestic interests of\nindividuals, groups, and political coalitions. Level 2 is the\ninternational game in which states compete to appease domestic\nposturing. The win-set, the possible set of actions considered\nacceptable to both the domestic coalition and the international\ncoalition, is dependent upon three major factors. 1. The distribution of\npower, preferences, and possible coalitions among level 2 constituents.\n2. The size of the representative body of political institutions. 3. The\nstrategies of the level 1 negotiators. The net effect of the three\nlimiting factors results in a win-set most probable to be ratified by\nthe domestic institutions. In other words, representatives bargaining on\nbehalf of powerful domestic coalitions must negotiate trade packages\nacceptable to their domestic handlers. To apply principal-agent theory\nto the intuition, the coalitions are the principle handling the\nrepresentative, their agent.</p>\n<p>Dahl’s work on bureaucratic politics and policy networks within the city\nof New Haven Connecticut is the foundation on which I will build to\nidentify the process of preferences becoming the action of a state. The\nbasis of his argument rests on the fact that certain actors possess the\nauthority to draft and to pass legislation. The units are the most\nimportant actors within the policy network. All of those actors that\ndepend on the actor with authority must lobby to institute policy. The\npower of the policy network is defined by their expertise, their social\nstanding, and their ability to satisfy the interests of the person or\npersons in positions of authority. Depending on the issue at hand and\nthose actors mobilized the policy network is highly dynamic. (Dahl,\n2005); (Dahl, 1957)</p>\n<p>Finnemore explores the ways in which international institutions acquire\na degree of autonomy and then may influence the states in the system by\ncreating rules and regulation to serve the interests of the organization\nitself. Her work relies heavily on sociological analysis of human\nsystems. At both the international level and the domestic level of\npolitics Finnemore’s work argues that as organizations are comprised of\nsocial actors the legal and social rules by which the institutions\noperate by serve primarily to benefit the preservation of the group.\nHowever, their legitimacy is dependent upon “external recognition” by\nthose ruled over (Finnemore 1999). In order, then to retain authority\nand legitimacy, the government bureaucracy must development effective\nmethods of socialization to convince the public of its legitimacy.\nScaled up to International Organizations bureaucratic legitimacy is\nequally dependent upon external validity. But as states are the only\nunits capable of effectively providing that validity, International\nOrganizations are wholly dependent on powerful states to enforce norms.\n(Finnemore 1999); (Finnemore 1993); Finnemore 2001)</p>\n<h2>Theoretical Intuition</h2>\n<p>Ultimately one must put forth a state centric argument in order to best\nexplain the operation of International Organizations and the\nInternational System more generally. This heart of this paper will rest\non the assumption that the state as an organization is most responsible\nfor influencing the character of the International System, and\nultimately the modification of International Organizations. It does not\nhowever, assume the state to be a rational entity capable of responding\nto external stimuli in a way that maximizes its gains. Rather, as all\nstates depend on domestic legitimacy in order to exist, states\nultimately operate in order to appease the demands of powerful domestic\nconstituencies, often without regard to the actions of other states.</p>\n<p>The structure of state can be thought of as a pyramidal hierarchy built\nupon increasing levels of authority within the state. The base of which\nis comprised of all of those people without any employment by the state.\nMoving up from there may be civil servants of the state bureaucracy.\nUltimately the pinnacle of which is the institution or institutions\nresponsible for the management of all lower levels. The most important\nfactor binding the structure is legitimacy as each level is inherently\ndependent on the external recognition of its legitimacy by the levels\nbeneath it. For instance, the Executive of the United States is\nessentially without power, except for that power which is recognized\nCongress and by extension the general public. A similar argument example\ncould be drawn for the military, the police, or any other institution\nwithin a state.</p>\n<p>The actual codification of this social process is by definition the law\nof a state. It may be thought of as the enforcement mechanism by which\nthe social structure is maintained and behavior standardized. Those\nwithin the state with the authority to create law are those with the\npower to socially reinforce their position of authority.[1] Thus it is\nparamount that a leader once in a position of authority also has the\nmeans of the state available to him in order to buttress his status.\nOtherwise law will be ignored and the state will devolve into anarchy.</p>\n<p>At the international the same processes occurs. Powerful states, be it\nmilitary power, or economic power, reinforce norms among weaker states\nin order to standardize behavioral outcomes. Great state in of\nthemselves may be able to accomplish this by force, but the legitimacy\nof those actions will always be perceived by lesser states as entirely\nillegitimate. Unless a legal institution comprised of members is\ndeveloped in order to give the lesser states the appearance of\ninfluence, all attempts to institute norms from a position of absolute\npower will surely fail. Hence the breakup of the English Empire. If\nnations, with distinct identities from that of the hegemon are to be\nmanaged a legal structure accepted to be legitimate must be created.</p>\n<p>Thus, International Organizations come into being. They are an attempt\nto institute a legal order binding to member states in order to minimize\nrisk ultimately at the behest of powerful states. The process by which\nweak states join the organization is straightforward. They do so because\nthe powerful coalitions within their state seek to acquire the resources\navailable to them when entering an International Organization. Such\nstates will adapt to the rules of the IO, but only to the extent that\nthe IO serves their interest. Otherwise they will refuse to join. Once\nthey have joined, they will recognize the legitimacy of the powerful\nstate, and the IO only if the disciplinary measures are effective, and\nthreaten their ability to rule domestically. There is also the option to\njoin the Organization established by another powerful state in the\nInternational System. If such an option is available, something like the\norder prior to the first world war, and that of the cold war will come\ninto being.</p>\n<p>For an IO then to be successful in setting the standards of the entire\ninternational system, all powerful states must be able to converge about\na set of common interests. In other words for an international\norganization to truly standardize norms throughout the international\nsystem all great powers must act in collaboration with one another to\nreinforce agreements to avoid undermining the legitimacy of the\ninstitution. The difficulty in achieving this is found in the fact the\ndictates of the international order do not determine great power\nbehavior, but rather the domestic forces which challenge the authority\nof its leaders do. The prime example of which is the United States war\nin Iraq under President George W. Bush. Despite the protests of the UN\nmember states, the government was forced to act under fear of losing\npopularity among its base.</p>\n<p>Only in highly technical and rather nonpolitical areas of international\naffairs does it appear that coalitions of powerful states can manage to\nconverge about a set of interests. Especially is this true when it comes\nto renegotiating the terms of membership.</p>\n<h2>Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I argue that international organizations modify the terms of\ntheir agreements only when it is in the interest of the powerful\ndomestic constituencies of a coalition of powerful member states. A\nstate cannot go it alone at the international level, nor will it\nsuccessfully ratify the agreement if it is not in the interest of the\ndomestic camp.</p>\n<h2>Design of the Test</h2>\n<p>I adopt the intuition of the two-level game, but avoid the calculus by\nway of preferences. Instead I adopt a calculus by way of expectations.\nPreferences are unbounded. Expectations however are the set of expected\noutcomes bounded by law and authority. In other words, expectations are\npreferences bounded by the exercise of a state’s institutions. As\ninstitutions are expected to act in such a way as to maintain\nlegitimacy, their free exercise is not unbounded. As opposed to the\nconvergence about preferences, I expect that win-sets will converge\nabout a common set of expectations that arise from the internal process\nof maintaining political legitimacy. To test my hypothesis then, I first\nanalyze the international organization. I then discern which states are\nthe most powerful. I then look to the issue, to see whether it is an\nissue is supported by domestic coalitions of the powerful states. If\nthat issue is agreed upon by the most influential states within the\norganization it is likely that new agreements will be signed, and the\npolicy of the organization will change.</p>\n<h2>Case Study</h2>\n<p>The transition of the GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)\nto the World Trade Organization will serve as the case study of\nanalysis. I will analyze the foundations of the GATT, the basic terms\nunder which the states agreed to enter into the agreement. Then I will\nlook to the World Trade Organization, and seek to explain why the most\npowerful states in the organization sought to expand the GATT and why\nthey agreed to the terms.</p>\n<p>The GATT, formed after the Second World War, spearheaded by the efforts\nof the United States and the United Kingdom, was the only multilateral\ninstrument governing international trade from 1948 until 1995 (Cite WTO\nwebsite). The point of its development was to liberalize trade and\nreduce tariffs between members. Interestingly within less than a month\nif its signing, the United States sought to expand the agreement to\ngovern all of international trade. The Havana conference of 1947 was to\ndo just that and to develop the International Trade Organization. The\ndeal proved to be incapable of ratification in the legislatures of many\nmember states, notable the Congress of the United States the leader of\nthe movement. Thus, marking the first in a series of failed attempts to\ncreate a multilateral body regulating trade.</p>\n<p>The GATT however was not an unsuccessful agreement. Periodic rounds of\nnegotiation, and subsequent agreements expanded the jurisdiction of the\norganization and granted to it greater legitimacy as the years passed.\nThe agreements eight round of agreements, the Uruguay Round of 1986-94\nis the most instrumental as it established the World Trade Organization.\nWhy is it that previous attempts to develop the body failed, but in this\none instance it came into being?</p>\n<p>The question is ultimately answered by identifying the expectations of\nthe domestic structures of the most powerful states attempting to\nrenegotiate the deal. Or what was it that the domestic structure\npressured the leaders of the state to do? This type of analysis will\nvary between states as it is dependent upon the institutional\norganization of the state. To simplify the process for this analysis, I\nlook primarily to who is responsible for ratifying the trade deal, and\nwho is it they are responsible to.</p>\n<p>The most powerful states at the time of the creation of the World Trade\nOrganization were in order the United States, Japan, Germany, France,\nItaly, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Brazil, and then Spain.[2] I\ncan further reduce the important states to the United States, the\nEuropean Union, Japan, and Canada, collectively known as the quad, as\nthey together account for most of international trade and the largest\nshare of international GDP (Databank: World Development Indicators).</p>\n<p>In the United States its Senate is officially responsible for the\nratification of international treaties. However, due to legislative\nenactments the process of ratification at the time the Uruguay rounds\nwas modified to require a majority vote in each of house of its Congress\nand the approval of the President. The President and his staff were\nresponsible for the negotiation of the deal. Thus, the expectations to\nanalyze are those of the constituencies which the members of the\nCongress and president rely on for appointment to their office. This\ndiffers between each group and is thus a very difficult process to\ndetermine. It is dependent upon the perceptions of the Congressman, and\nthe advice of their most important allies. They will vote for a deal\nonly if it is perceived to be a political win. A thorough analysis would\nrequire reviewing the vote of each senator and then inferring the\nconstituents responsible for their appointment and the expectations of\neach group. As this is untenable, reviewing the actions of the president\nis actually a valid point of view to determine the aggregate\nexpectations of those within the domestic structure as the ratification\nof the bill is dependent upon their support. Thus, the president is\nnegotiating on their behalf. (Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. Chapter 12);\n(U.S. Constitution, Article 1 Sect. 3); (U.S. Constitution, Amendment\n17)</p>\n<p>The European Union is comprised of a very different political structure\nof hierarchal authority. Individual states do not negotiate trade deals.\nRather the European Commission comprised of appointed members negotiate\ndeals on the behalf of the entire union. These deals must be approved by\nthe European Parliament which is comprised of elected representatives\nfrom each of the members states, but the ultimate power to ratify the\nagreements falls with the council. Members of the council are the heads\nof state each EU member state. Their position in power is dependent upon\nthe domestic structures of their individual states. Nonetheless, when\nbargaining internationally, they are doing so in order to maintain their\nposition as leader. Thus, they will not agree to a deal that will\ncompromise their domestic coalitions. (The European Council, 2018); (The\nEuropean Parliament: About Parliament).</p>\n<p>The Japanese “Diet”, the state’s version of parliament is responsible\nfor the ratification of treaties and international trade deals. The\nexecutive cabinet is solely responsible for the negotiation of the deals\naided by its bureaucracy. However, as Japan is a parliamentary state,\nunlike the United States, the prime minister, the executive of the\ncountry, possesses almost free ability to institute law. This is due to\nparty discipline, and the fact that as the head of the government, the\nprime minister is also the head of the party in possession of the\nmajority seats in the parliament. What then the executive negotiates\nwill most likely be passed. There is surely an internal bargaining\nprocess, but it is not as crucial to the process as that of the United\nStates. (Fundamental Structure of the Government of Japan, 2007);\n(Structure of the National Diet, 2014).</p>\n<p>Canada is also structured around a Parliamentary government. The\nexecutive committee like that of japan is centered around the prime\nminister. The prime minister and his cabinet negotiate the trade deals\nand then put it to parliament for ratification. The same rules of party\ndiscipline apply here as in Japan. The likelihood of a trade deal\nnegotiated by the executive cabinet being ratified is very high.\n(Parliamentary Primer).</p>\n<p>According to my hypothesis then, these states will renegotiate the GATT\nagreements when it is in the domestic interests of the heads of states\nresponsible for the ratification of the trade deal. The most difficult\nstate to accomplish in would be the United States as the greatest number\nof individuals are responsible for ratification. And, because the\npossible domestic win-set is the smallest in relationship to the other\npowers. It is then expected that the United States will find it most\ndifficult to ratify the World Trade Organization agreement.</p>\n<h2>Findings</h2>\n<p>As expected the Quad States (United States, Canada, Japan, EU) were by\nfar the most important states involved in the process of negotiation.\nTheir economic power and political clout were necessary to develop an\ninternational organization with actual effect on international trade.\nThus, the states with economic value were essentially ignored in this\nprocess. (VanGrasstek, 2013).</p>\n<p>Ratification of the deals also depended on the perceptions of the\ndomestic coalitions of states engaged in talks. Dispute resolutions,\nagricultural subsidies, and auto tariffs were the most contentious\nissues between the Quad. Each sate feared primarily the delegitimizing\ntheir domestic governments. The United States and the EU for instance\ndisputed over pork tariffs seriously enough to threaten the deal\noutright. The United States senators and the president were concerned\nthat a deal that lifted subsidies would put a large number of their\nconstituencies out of a job. If this were to occur they thought their\npositions of authority would be compromised. (VanGrasstek, 2013).</p>\n<p>The solution to the problem came about in the form of substantial\ndispute resolution mechanisms to solve the enforcement problem. The\nUnited States as the most influential member of the organization most\nlikely assumed that it could use the Dispute Settlement Body to its own\nend. The other states in the system perceived it to be capable enough to\nbind the United States to internationally agreed to norms and\nconsensuses on trade. The goal of course to put an end to politically\ndisruptive tariff spikes targeted at politically relevant sectors of\neconomies. Or in other words to regulate international trade in order to\nput an end to trade wards. This to all states at the time seemed to be\nvital to securing the domestic expectations of their constituencies. The\nintent of all measures is to ensure a domestic win at the time of\nsigning, but also to ensure ongoing win-sets across time (Fearon, 1998).\nThe World Trade Organization embodies that it is inherently an\norganization designed to satisfy the demands of the members states not\nto act as an independent body. (VanGrasstek, 2013).</p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>Regarding when international organizations likely to modify their\nagreements, they appear to do so when a coalition of powerful states can\nagree to do so. Such a straightforward answer to the question seems\nobvious however, in the process of research many questions arose as to\nif this is actually true. I began this research from an entirely\ndifferent point of view. I sought to answer whether Non-Governmental\nOrganizations (NGO) could influence Inter-Governmental organization to\nadopt new policy.</p>\n<p>The answer to that question led me to study states as opposed NGO’s\nbecause in order for an NGO to influence an IGO powerful states must be\nrecruited to the cause. The global civil society literature is fairly\nadamant about this. Thus, I led astray from studying only NGO’s and\ninstead sought to understand why states may modify existing IGO’s or\ndevelop new ones.</p>\n<p>States are a far more interesting unit of analyses as all forms of\ninfluence within the state could be studied to determine if domestic\npolitics really does lead to international politics. To this I would say\nthat there is no doubt that international politics begins at home. The\nLogic of the Two Level Game cannot be ignored. Leaders dependent upon\ndomestic coalitions must act accordingly to realize their expectations\nor risk losing office. From this one could see how domestic perceptions\nof economic conditions, human rights, or any other issue can influence a\nstate’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Thus, when approaching IGO’s and the forces which influence their\noperation, not only is it more interesting look to states, but also far\nmore functional than attempting to discern the influence of NGO’s\noperating within states. Such an analysis requires testimony from policy\nmakers, meeting minutes, extensive media analysis, and a harmonious\nrelationship with an NGO, an IGO, and a state bureaucracy. Frankly\nspeaking these resources were not available, nor was I able to establish\ncontact with any of the important players. Therefore, one had to default\nto observation from the point of view of a neutral observer.</p>\n<p>In so doing it became evident that states, whether one likes it or not,\nsolely possess the legal authority and material capability to influence\nIGO’s. Civil society on the other hand, while influential, is without\nthe authority or means to actually bring about legitimate change.\nInstitutions trusted by citizens, or even possibly willed into being by\nmilitary force, are those with the legitimate power to actually enforce\nlaws and norms. As such, I adopted Dahl’s intuition into decision making\nthat institutions with legal authority regulate and standardize decision\nmaking procedures and also patterns of influence. These institutions are\nthe field in which those seeking to acquire influence play, and\ntherefore adapt to the rules. Without then needing to further delve into\nthis process I chose to instead analyze relationships between states, as\nopposed to analyzing the operations of NGO’s.</p>\n<p>This paper is in need of expansion however in one crucial category. It\nassumes wholeheartedly that the leaders of states are entirely dependent\non the whims of their domestic coalitions and that they are incapable of\nemploying any tactics to manipulate them. A new research project that\nexplores the topic in depth is in need. To make the assumption that the\npreferences of influential leaders do not play a role in international\npolitics is too great a pill to swallow.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When do International Organizations renegotiate the terms of their\nagreements? They do so when powerful states within the organization\ncompel it do so. The logic of the Two-Level game though indicates that\nthe process is dependent on the expectations of domestic coalitions.\nAlso, the relative power between states makes it so that only a minority\nof powerful states are actually important when attempting to renegotiate\ndeals. A win-set is achieved when the expectations of the domestic\ncoalitions of the most relevant states converge about a deal. The\ntransition of the GATT to the World Trade Organization as case study\ndemonstrates this process. The Quad states, the most relevant state in\nthe international economy Rather, it is apparent that the need for\npoliticians to maintain their domestic coalitions was more important to\nthe calculus of the leaders than the acquisition of power or wealth.</p>\n<h2>Works Cited</h2>\n<p>Dahl, Robert Alan. “Who Governs?
